## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Steps to execute your code

Step 1 : Open the src/App.java file.
Step 2 : In line 84 of the code in the FileReader, add the path to the input file as the first argument.
Step 3 : Run the code.

## Overview and Approach 

Used Trie structure for this problem. The trie data structure allows us to perform inserion and search operations in O(n) where N is the length of the word.
